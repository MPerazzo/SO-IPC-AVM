*Now the client sends a Datagram to the server and the last one modifies the content and sends it back to the client.

*To run it successfully we will use two terminals as there are two mains:

	1- gcc -o server server.c communicationSockets.c
	2- gcc -o client client.c communicationSockets.c
	3- In the current terminal, ./server
	4- Open new terminal, use CD, ./client

*Marshalling modified using memcpy from data struct to datagram and viceversa, considering the following:
1- The structure doesnt contain pointers, as the memory adresses are relative to the client or server.
2- Client and server are executed from CPUÂ´s of same arquitecture.
3- Data on structures filled to data bus word does not break the programm.

*This implementation can stand multiple servers running as long as they dont have the same ports and IP assigned.

*Logging Deamon implementation assigns same queue values to all the servers, so to know from which server the message is, a field containing the pid was added to the message struct.
