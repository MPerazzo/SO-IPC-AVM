*Some pieces of code were inspired from:

*Marshalling modified using memcpy from data struct to datagram and viceversa, considering the following:
1- The structure doesnt contain pointers, as the memory adresses are relative to the client or server.
2- Client and server are executed from CPUÂ´s of same arquitecture.
3- Packing flag on structures is set to 0.

*Logging Deamon implementation assigns same queue values to all the servers, so to know from which server the message is, a field containing the pid was added to the message struct.

*Implementation of threading on serverThreading.c works up to 10 sessions, as the max length of the vector of threads was defined to be 10.
