*Some pieces of code were inspired from:

*Marshalling modified using memcpy from data struct to datagram and viceversa, considering the following:
1- The structure doesnt contain pointers, as the memory adresses are relative to the client or server.
2- Client and server are executed from CPUÂ´s of same arquitecture.
3- Packing flag on structures is set to 0.

*This implementation can stand multiple servers running as long as they dont have the same ports and IP assigned.

*Logging Deamon implementation assigns same queue values to all the servers, so to know from which server the message is, a field containing the pid was added to the message struct.
